  <h3>In Search of Moral, Physical, Political and Social Health for the Community</h3>

  <p>The military defeats of the Germans during the Napoleonic wars and the defeats of the Swedes by the Russians at the beginning of the 19th century led to a reconceptualization of the gymnastics movement and the placing of political and military goals before it. Physical preparedness, together with paramilitary practices and patriotic education, would strengthen and regenerate not only an individual person, but also the entire modern community—the nation. The practical manifestation of this ideal on German lands was the creation of a series of gymnastics associations (Turnverein), inspired by the «father» of German gymnastics, Friedrich Ludwig Jahn. The concept of the education of a disciplined, organized, and healthy nation became very popular in the 19th century and gained wide diffusion throughout Central and Eastern Europe. The gymnastics movement became one of the main paths of national emancipation in the context of the Hapsburg Empire.</p>

  <h4>German and Swedish Gymnastics Models</h4>

  <p>In 1793 the German pedagogue Johann Friedrich GutsMuths published the book Gymnastics for youth, in which he laid out principles of gymnastics exercises. A series of exercises, worked out by GutsMuths, demanded the completion of specific athletic exercises with the help of sports equipment. Another model was proposed by the Swede Per Henrik Ling. Although he used the ideas of GutsMuths, he considered exercises with equipment too burdensome and unjustifiably complex. Ling’s gymnastics were based on a series of free exercises, without equipment. This easier Swedish gymnastics model played an important role in creating the theoretical and methodological foundations of physical education in schools.</p>
