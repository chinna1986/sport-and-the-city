<h3>Fitness, or Physical Culture: Sport for Everyone, and for Society</h3>

  <p>Fitness unites the ideal and the pragmatic: a desire for the harmonious development of the human individual and the improvement of individual health for the needs of the society or state.</p>
  <p>The myth about the ideal Soviet person—the idea of a healthy body and a high level of physical training—became one of the principles of the communist educational system. The Soviet Man was a citizen of a state setting a course for the construction of an ideal system, communism, and so the Soviet Man had to be a model of a harmoniously developed individual. At the same time, fitness also fulfilled practical goals—from improving each citizen’s health to preparing citizens to fulfill their responsibilities, whether at war or at work.</p>
  <p>The official and accepted term in the Soviet scientific and practical lexicon was fizkultura, or “physical culture.” In Soviet society this became a sign of modernity, brought by the new power of the Bolsheviks in 1917. At the Third All-Russian Congress of the Russian Communist Union of Youth (Komsomol) in 1920 fitness was declared an important part of youth education.</p>    
  <p>But Soviet physical culture was more than just sports. It included both physical exercises for various ages, social and gender categories, as well as hygienic practices and hardening, which facilitated not only the development of the body, but also the molding of willpower.</p> 
  <p>Although the phenomenon of fizkultura is first and foremost associated with the Soviet Union, the emphasis on physical health was present in state policies of other countries as well. The practice of state care for the health of the nation dominated in many societies in the 1930s. The human body was not considered as individual, but as part of the entire “body of the nation.” For this reason, “care” for the body became a matter concerning the entire nation, and the state claimed the absolute right for its realization. In Nazi Germany the body became an “ideological form” embodying the Aryan ideal. In Italy physicality became a part of the cult of “Unity, Energy, Purity.”  In Britain the “National Fitness Campaign” was introduced in 1937. This campaign was widely promoted by the journal Health and Strength. France, too, set a course for improving the health of the nation through sport in 1938. The values of le sportif, or “sportiveness,” were spread primarily through educational institutions.</p> 
  <p>Fizkultura in the Soviet Union, éducation physique in France and Leibeserziehung in Germany, or physical education in Britain reflected not only the cultivation of healthy citizens, but also served as an instrument of rivalry between governments for first place in international competitions.</p>

  <h4>“Ready for Work and Defense”</h4>
  <p>Fitness in the Soviet Union was intended to prepare citizens, especially youth, to serve the state both through labor in production, and through physical preparedness to defend socialist society in war. In practice, this was accomplished through obligatory exercises performed at work and the general state system called «GTO,” that is, “Ready for Work and Defense”.</p>
  <p>This system from 1931 was based on the physical-patriotic education of the population from 10 to 60 years old. It was a kind of Stakhanovite movement, but for sport, and was supposed to include almost all inhabitants of the Soviet state. An All-Union matrix of norms was divided into different categories by age. The program “Bold and Agile” was created for boys aged 10-11 and girls aged 12-13; “The Sporting Shift” for teenagers from 14-15 years old; “Strength and Boldness” for youth between 16-18 years old;  “Physical Perfection” for men 19-39 years old and women 19-34 years old; and finally, “Cheerfulness and Health” for men aged 40-60 and women aged 35-55.  For the fulfillment of norms, the state awarded special badges—although these were aluminum, they were still a sign of honor.</p>
