    <h3>Who’s Who in Soviet Sports: The System of Sports Associations</h3>
    
    <p>In Soviet times life without the involvement of the state and Communist Party was practically impossible. Sports, too, existed in a close intertwining with politics and ideology. The path towards industrialization forged in Stalinist times served as an incentive for creating a specific system of sports associations under the aegis of industries, educational institutions and governmental agencies.</p>
    <p>The politicization of sport was apparent not only because Komsomol organizations existed in every sports team, but also because each team had its own «political director,» a player who was responsible for maintaining communist ideals. In the Soviet Union official sports organizations unconnected to a governmental department or branch of production simply did not exist. The names of these associations, under the aegis of which teams from various sports from hockey to gymnastics competed, speak for themselves.</p>
    <p>The general system of sports clubs in the USSR created in the 1930s was active throughout the entire Union and spread from the center to the periphery.</p>
    <p>Soviet republics, therefore, had the same clubs with the same names; for example, there was a team «Dynamo» in Kyiv, Tbilisi, and Moscow. But there were also teams whose names had a more local flavor--for example «Karpaty» (referring to the Carpathian Mountains), «Dnipro» (Kyiv’s majestic river), and «Ararat» (the highest peak in Armenia). However, these locally-inspired team names were more the exception than the rule.</p>
    <p>In the 1960s there was a reorganization of the system of sports associations. All of them were unified in six clubs: Burevisnyk, Labor Reserves, Vodnyk, Locomotive, Spartak and Zenith. Later, in 1987, after the next reorganization each republic of the USSR ran two sports clubs, which united industry and agriculture. For the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic this was Avant-Garde and Kolos. Dynamo and SKA retained special status and did not enter into the general list of voluntary sports associations.</p>
    <p>A similar system existed throughout the Soviet bloc: «Vashash» in Hungary, «Gurnik» in Poland, «Sparta» in Czechoslovakia, «Forwerts» in the GDR, «Partisan» in Yugoslavia. This system did not operate continuously throughout the Soviet period, however.</p>
