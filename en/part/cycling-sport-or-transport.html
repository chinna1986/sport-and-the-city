<h3>CYCLING: SPORT OR Transport</h3>

<p>Long ago the bicycle transformed from a piece of sports equipment into a method of transport. This was necessitated by changes in cities themselves, and in everyday life in cities. Throughout the 19th century cities grew sharply, and their inhabitants had to overcome greater and greater distances.</p>
  <p>In 1867 Ernest Michaux patented his discovery at an exhibition in Paris: the bicycle. From the moment of the bicycle’s entry onto the market it provoked mad popularity—both for athletics and for transport. Already by 1869 Paris held the first cycling competition, for a distance of 123 kilometers from Paris to Rouen. We can also trace the great popularity of the bicycle by the luxurious advertising for such brands as Peugeot, Hermes, Gladiator, or Sirius, in the style of a European secession-style posters.</p>
  <p>Today in poorer regions of the world the bicycle has remained an important method of moving around the city; in wealthier regions ecological awareness has led to an increased use of the bicycle. In Scandinavian countries the use of the bicycle as a method of urban transport has taken especial hold. For example, in Copenhagen 40% of city inhabitants use a bicycle as transport—and the number is constantly growing.</p>

  <h4>Lviv and the Bicycle</h4>

  <p>The bicycle first came to Lemberg (Lviv) in 1867 and immediately acquired great popularity among the population: the publication of a special journal called Das Velocipede (1869), the first cycling club and places to rent bicycles (1880). By the pre-World War I period Lemberg (Lviv) was producing 100 bicycles a day, and after the war the Lwów (Lviv) bicycle factory was one of the best known in the city.</p>
  <p>Historic cities, with narrow streets and inadequate space for parking, have experienced the rise in automobiles especially profoundly. Pressing problems include traffic jams, car accidents, parking in pedestrian zones, and carbon dioxide in the environment.  For precisely this reason the appearance of cycling lanes and  proper arrangement of public space directly affects the quality of city life.</p>
  <p>Lviv became the first Ukrainian city to comprehensively approach the question of developing urban cycling infrastructure. Combined initiatives have facilitated a quick start to the construction of the first urban cycling infrastructure in Ukraine.</p>
