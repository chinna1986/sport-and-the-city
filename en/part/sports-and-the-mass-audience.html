<h3>Sports and the Mass Audience</h3>

<p>In the interwar years the increasingly large «army» of fans became an important force in sports. During the «roaring ‘20s» in the West new lifestyles, new ideals and new forms of entertainment flourished, and glamour, exclusivity and movement defined the new urban culture. </p>
<p>Sports, spectacular and dynamic, became just as much an object of adulation as the cinema. Not only participants, but also spectators became objects of interest for business, as well as public, political and state actors. Athletics became more and more an active means of influencing a wide public. </p>
<p>At the same time technical developments created new possibilities and new ways of involving fans and spectators in sports events. Mass-media played a key role. Thanks to newspapers and radio fanship was not limited to attending an event in person, but became an everyday practice.</p>
<p>The increasing popularity of sports spectacles after World War I forced organizers to arrange events on a significantly larger scale than they had previously. Sports societies, which represented various kinds of athletics, began to build separate stadiums and sports complexes using the latest construction technology and materials. One of the most important moments was the introduction of electric light in stadiums, which allowed fans who worked during the day to attend athletic events.</p>
<p>In Poland the use of stadium lights was introduced fairly late—in the mid-1930s. In this case, just as in the hosting of football matches, Lviv (or rather, Lwow) came first. In 1931 during the match between the clubs «Hasmonea» and «Old boy» at the stadium of the 19th infantry division located at the Citadel, it was decided as an experiment to illuminate the field with military projectors.</p>

<h4>Sports and Mass Politics</h4>

<p>In the interwar period European countries fully encouraged enthusiasm for sports among their citizens and even gave «technical» support. It is well-known that in Lviv on the days of important sports events an additional tramway #11A circulated through the city—from the train station to Stryiskyi Park. In many cities the public was directly involved in important matches or competitions by live broadcasts from loudspeakers on downtown streets. In Lviv public sports broadcasts could be heard on Academic Street (now Prospect Shevchenko). </p>
<p>Sports’ ability to unite people quickly in great communal solidarity was one of the most effective instruments of mass politics. Here is how a spectator describes a street audience listening to a broadcast of a football match in Warsaw 1936:</p>
<p>«There it is! Goal! The crowd buzzes and shakes. Joy shines on their faces. A cry resounds: Long may they live! The hats of young enthusiasts fly high over their heads. But not only youth are caught up in enthusiasm. Some bearded merchant in a long coat claps his hands fiercely and yells: Bravo, encore! And here’s some old woman in an old-style coat who devoutly places her hands in prayer and whispers with wrinkled lips: Oh my God, Oh my God... I bet that as long as she’s lived, she’s never seen a football match, never been to a stadium, but the powerful wave of the joy of victory has captured her.»</p>
