  <h3>Cyber Sports</h3>

  <p>The world changes: it becomes electrified, automated. People prefer the virtual world to the real one. The plots of 1970s fantasy films are coming true. With the development of technology the mass understanding of play, interaction and sport are expanding. Video games, which do not require any movement or physical exertion, are becoming a sport just like any other. Their popularity only grows.</p>
  <p>In 1980 the first-ever competition in cyber sports (also spelled as CyberSports, or even cybersports) took place: 10 thousand players competed in a tournament of games called «Space Invaders» at video arcades. By 2006 the World Cyber Games included participants from 70 countries, and the first-place prize was $462,000.</p>
  <p>Among the countless video games, each of which can embody any aspect of possible reality, sports video games are appearing, and are especially popular among fans. The games offer an attractive opportunity to be simultaneously a sports strategist and a star athlete, to have a little taste of real sports—all without leaving home.</p>
  <p>Before the 2012 European Championship in Football  an official video game for UEFA Euro 2012 was created. The game, released in April 2012, depicts 8 stadiums of Ukraine and Poland. The players have multiple opportunities to form teams that will compete against European nations and upload their own profile.</p>
