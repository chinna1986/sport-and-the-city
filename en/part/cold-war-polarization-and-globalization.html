  <h3>Cold War: Polarization and Globalization</h3>

  <h4>The Olympic Tradition Reborn</h4>
  <p>Western states, many of whom were colonial empires, initiated the «rebirth» of the Olympic tradition at the end of the 19th century. Creating an international competition at the global level was considered an important step towards encouraging global understanding and peace. The idea of the «renaissance» of the Olympic movement appeared as early as the middle of the 19th century, and the main proponent was Evangelis Zappa, a Greek-Romanian philanthropist. The idea was further developed by the French baron Pierre de Courbertain, who in 1894 initiated the creation of the International Olympic Committee. Italy, Greece, Great Britain, Russia, Austria-Hungary, France, Sweden and Norway, the USA, New Zealand and Argentina were the first to belong to this committee. The first «new» Olympic games were held in Athens in 1896 and united 14 states. The Olympics continued in this format until World War I. After the war, with the collapse of the two empires of Austria-Hungary and Russia, it was national states that competed in the Olympic games.</p>

  <h4>Spartakiad as an alternative to the Olympics</h4>

  <p>The spread of socialist movements in Europe and the victory of the Bolshevik revolution in the Russian empire created a possibility for a different model of social development: communism. This included the rejection of older «imperial» practices, which were judged to be based on colonialism, racial stereotypes and segregation. In 1920 in Lucerne the social-democrats of Belgium, France and Germany created the «Workers Sports International,» which organized Workers Olympiads against bourgeois-ism. The first «Worker’s Olympiad» was held in 1925 in Frankfurt-am-Main.</p>
  <p>The Soviet Union, however, proposed a radical project. The «Red Sports International» appeared in 1921 on the initiative of the USSR and united workers’ sports organizations from Czechoslovakia, Estonia, France, Italy, Norway, Uruguay, the USA and the USSR. This organization proposed alternative athletic competitions: the Spartakiad. This title, like the Olympics, recalled ideals from antiquity, but proposed an «eternal class struggle» and so chose Spartak, the leader of the slave uprising, as its hero. The first Spartakiad was held in 1928: winter games in Oslo, summer games in Moscow. But this athletic movement did not enjoy widespread international success, and at the end of the 1930s the Spartakiad movement became associated more with professional unions, the army and students. The Spartakiad competitions between the peoples of the USSR took place throughout the Soviet period and generally occurred a year before each Olympic games.</p>
  <h4>Cold War Compromise: Confrontation and Engagement</h4>

  <p>After World War II two processes shaped the world: decolonialization, that is, the collapse of colonial empires, and the Cold War. In the postwar decades the former colonies of the Middle East, Asia and Africa achieved independence. A significant number of these countries, as a result of seizures of power or revolutions, became communist. The world became polarized. The capitalist and the communist blocs faced each other in the arms race, the space race, and multiple political conflicts. But they also created a mutual space for competition: the Olympic games. In a time of «peaceful coexistence» between the capitalist and socialist systems the Olympic games became a kind of surrogate for the Cold War.</p>
