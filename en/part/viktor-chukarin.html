  <h3>Viktor Chukarin: The Image Concealing Reality</h3>
  <p>In the burnished image of the Soviet hero there was little space for anything personal. Viktor Chukarin became the athletic icon of his time. In the press he was presented as a model to follow: precise, focused, undefeated, a man-machine. «With an expression of absolute peace on his face he completed exercises of dizzying difficulty,» or so the newspapers wrote about him.</p>
  <p>Chukarin’s official life history is a story of the formation of a Soviet hero. Before the war he defended the title of sports master and was one of many filling the ranks of youth physically «prepared for labor and defense» of the USSR. During World War II he volunteered for the frontlines. As a German prisoner of war, he survived the concentrations camps of Buchenwald and Sandbostel, and was also on a mined barge that the Nazis planned to drown together with its passengers. It was a miracle that he escaped death. After the war the former prisoner returned home. This is not only the story of the return home of a boy weighing only 40 kilograms and whom even his mother had difficulty recognizing: «I was so thin and horrifying that even my own mother recognized me only by a scar on my head that had remained with me from childhood.» This is above all the story of the indestructibility of the Soviet athlete and citizen. Chukarin returned to sports, trained with gymnastics champion Adzhat Ibadulaievich, and later beat him. Valentyn Muratov, Viktor’s colleague, remembers how he trained on the model of German gymnasts, who in 1936 were the absolute champions. Chukarin was recognized for his focused persistence: he trained every day, and not four days a week, like other athletes. From 1949-1951 Viktor Chukarin three times became the USSR’s all-around champion, and in 1952 and 1956 he attained the title of all-around Olympic champion. In 1954 he won the world championship title. Moreover, Chukarin won the majority of his titles when he was over 30 years old. At the height of his fame he ended his career--undefeated.</p>
  <p>But Chukarin’s official biography hid many moments from his life, because it was necessary to make his image acceptable for the Soviet state’s ideological framework. Nothing was mentioned about the «undesirable» fact that Viktor Chukarin’s father was repressed as an «enemy of the people,» or that he wrote a letter to his Romanian friend with a request to please send food, sorely lacking at that time. There was also necessary silence about the period in Chukarin’s life when he was a prisoner of war and worked on a farm in Kappel-Neufeld for a German family with whom Viktor remained in close contact. Political reality allowed for no contact with them after the war. Viktor Chukarin himself was not happy  about giving an interview about his experience as a prisoner, because such details from his past could provoke judgment.</p>
