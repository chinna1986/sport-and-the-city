<h3>Sport in the Camps: Escape from War</h3>

  <p>On the background of wartime and postwar scarcity competition and opposition in sports was not as important as during peacetime. And so sport were then seen as most of all a kind of leisure, as a way of returning to normal life, even if not for long.</p>
  <p>Sports played a special role in the various forced labor camps where prisoners of war were held. Simple kinds of sports that did not require special equipment offered prisoners one of the only ways of relaxing from their difficult reality, to attempt to recall their lost life from before the war. Camp officials, as a rule, tolerated the athletic enthusiasm of the prisoners. Such games, therefore, were often used as a cover for forbidden activity—communication with other groups of prisoners or even escape.</p>
  <p>"(S)ports between Ukrainian prisoners ...filled an important function of moral support in the unenviable everyday life of the prisoners of war and were a first-rate help for mutual knowledge and becoming closer with representatives of other peoples and threw not once clear rays of hope in the darkness of camp life behind the wires." Ievhen Birchak, organizer of Ukrainian sport movement in DP camps (Almanac of the Council of Physical Culture,  Munich, 1951)</p>
  
  <h4>Displaced Sports</h4>

  <p>Even after the cessation of hostilities Europe still suffered the consequences of the war for a long time. The peripatetic quality of wartime drove huge masses of Ukrainians, Poles, Lithuanians, Estonians, and other exiles from East Central Europe away from their native cities. They all ended up in displaced persons camps organized by the allied troops. Forced to live in these camps for several years, the displaced persons organized schools, social organizations and, of course, sports teams. For people who had lost their homes, their families and their homelands, sports were not just leisure, but an important instrument in declaring normality and humanity. An important gesture was the introduction in various cities in Germany of the "Displaced Persons Olympiad." This event took place in summer-fall of 1948—together with the Olympic Games in London. In this way, the organizers, the International Committee of Political Refugees, wanted to attract the world public's attention and prove their legitimacy.</p>
  <p>"… These games will be no competition for the Great Olympiad, they do not even have this inclination. They will only be only another proof of the solidarity of members of the oppressed nations exiled from their homelands, they must be a proof of their moral and physical skill." (Oleh Lysiak, sports journalist (Almanac of the Council of Physical Culture, Munich, 1953)</p>
  <p>It is possible that it was at the camp Olympiad that the anthem "Ukraine has not yet perished" rang out for the first time before the start of a competition. Ukrainians showed their best results in football, easily defeating the other finalists—Poles and Lithuanians.</p>
  
  <h4>"The Olympic Spirit" Behind Barbed Wire</h4>

  <p>"The Displaced Persons Olympiad" was not the only and not the first celebration of the "Olympic spirit" in the camps. In 1944 the XIII Olympic Games were supposed to take place in London, but were moved to 1948 because of the war. The International Olympic Committee still organized several anniversary celebrations in the Swiss city of Lausanne. As became known after the war, during the summer of 1944 the XIII Olympic Games were also remembered in two camps for Polish prisoners of war on the territory of Germany: in the villages of Gross Born and Woldenberg. The prisoners created a series of handmade stamps and postcards dedicated to the Olympics that did not take place.</p>

  <h4>Physically Prepared – And so, Armed!</h4>

  <p>The goal of athletic paramilitary organizations was the preparation of members for possible war. With the approach of real hostilities these former athletes became soldiers and fought against their enemies in direct—not athletic—methods. However, their good physical condition gave them clear advantage above other fighters. It was not uncommon for people connected with sports to be given special tasks—skiers and runners became couriers, shooters became snipers, parachutists became saboteurs behind the frontlines in the rear.</p>
  <p>In a different form, paramilitary athletic organizations during the war gave even young people an opportunity to express themselves. Well-known is the example of the scouting group "White Couriers" (Biali kurierzy) created on the base of junior Polish civil military athletic club "Junak," which was active in interwar Drohobych. After the arrival of Soviet power in western Ukraine young athletes, using their athletic skills, helped people cross the Hungarian border. On their return the "white couriers" delivered to the Polish underground money and information.</p>
