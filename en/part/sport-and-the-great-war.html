<h3>Sport and the Great War: 1914-1918</h3>

  <p>War, above all, is associated with the end of normal life. Activities common during peacetime, like entertainment, relaxation, enjoying cultural events and taking part in sports, all become impossible in wartime. In fact, from the start of World War I in Galicia, just as in Europe, all championships and sports competitions were cancelled, the activity of clubs and associations came to a halt, many athletes went off to the frontlines, and the construction of new sports facilities ceased. A declaration forbidding public gatherings in Lviv made mass sports activity impossible.</p>
  <p>However, the war did not signify the end of sports. Just a month after the start of the war, there were attempts to organize athletic life in Lviv—to arrange games between civil and military populations. Football players played both against the Austrian and the German troops, quartered in Lviv (or Lemberg), as well as against the Russians, who occupied Galicia in the fall of 1914. The games were organized continuously, and when teams did not have enough players, spectators were invited onto the field, in order to ensure that the match would take place.</p>
  <p>At the front, soldiers in the trenches also took part in sports. Sport was a way of «returning to normalcy» and military leadership encouraged training during leave time with the goal of the physical and moral rehabilitation of soldiers. The emotions experienced by the soldiers during the athletic games provided an opportunity to establish friendly relations in the company and to create an atmosphere of «male solidarity.»</p>
  <p>The war erased the lines between what was considered «normal,» and what was considered «not normal.» Normal activities acquired new meanings and often demanded additional strength or manipulation. For example, in order that the match of the Polish football team Pogon take place in Lviv (or Lwów) in spring 1916, staff officer Mieczysław Młotek called the famous Lwóow footballer Wacław Kuchar back from the front. This was possible because staff officer Młotek had been a trainer of the Drohobych football team before the war, and so he knew Kuchar as an excellent striker. An additional factor facilitating this feat was the fact that Kuchar could bring a film camera from Lwow, since his father owned several movie theaters in the city.</p>
