  <h3>Zdvyh and Zlot: Mass Rituals in Urban Public Space</h3>

  <p>Carrying out mass public rituals—celebrations, demonstrations, walks through the city, gatherings—was a very popular practice among gymnastics societies in Europe. Public demonstration of gymnastic, military and fire-fighting exercises was not only an act of physical skill, but was placed by the organizers in wider social and political context. By demonstrating discipline, organization, and ability to fulfill orders, sports meetings and rallies were supposed to show a wider public that the nation was one organism, consisting of harmoniously developed individuals all ready to work for the common good and, when needed, to fight for higher national goals. In this way, the successful completion of physical exercises during a rally was, most of all, a symbolic act of representation of one or another national ideology. </p>
  <p>The Polish Sokol groups had congresses, which they called rallies, zlot. The first Polish rally was organized in Lwów in 1892. One of the largest mass events of the Polish Sokols was the Grunewald rally, which took place in summer 1910 in Krakow in honor of the 500-year anniversary of the victory over the Teutonic Livonian Knights. </p>
  <p>Among Ukrainians of Galicia popular events were the Sich celebrations and the so-called zdvyhy (rallies, in Ukrainian). The most public rallies were the regional rallies in 1911 and 1914 in Lviv, which gathered 8,000 and 12,000 participants respectively for the performance of gymnastic, fire-fighting and military exercises. </p>
  <p>These congresses in Lwów were accompanied by additional tensions, however. Each mass demonstration--despite its «peaceful» character--was seen by the organizers as an attempt to «conquer» and «mark» the Polish or Ukrainian symbolic spaces of the city in opposition to other national projects.</p>
