  <h3>«Sport and the City: People. Society. Ideology»</h3>
  <p>Exhibition offers you an opportunity to learn more about the meaning of sports, besides competition, entertainment and spectacle. It traces the history of sports in Lviv (also known as Lwów and Lemberg) throughout the last 150 years: the beginnings of sports in Europe, and particularly in the city; how our ideas about sports have changed; how new types of sports emerged; the connections between sports and nationalism, sports and government, sports and commerce, sports and globalization. Particularly interesting in the context of EURO-2012 is the question of fan culture and the potential of sports mega-events for the city. This exposition shows different meanings connected with sports and allows to formulate own answers to the question, «What was sport, and what is sport today?»</p>
  <p>The exhibition space, thematically divided into five sections, opens with the theme, «Sports as Social and Cultural Practice: History of Transformations.» This section presents the history of sports as a history of modern social and cultural practices. The next section, <a href="/sport-in-multiethnic-city/">«Sports in the Multi-ethnic City, 1861-1939»</a>, focuses attention on Lviv-Lwów-Lemberg itself. Local historical materials connected with the history of the city’s three communities - Ukrainian, Polish, and Jewish - show how sports were a factor and form in the search for new identities. The third section, <a href="/sport-and-of-total-war/">«Sport and War»</a>, examines sports in the conditions of military conflict - during the First and Second World Wars. The following section of the exhibition, <a href="/sportsin-soviet-cities-1939-1991/">«Sport in the Soviet City, 1944-1991»</a>, explores the notion of physical culture, the social status of Soviet athletes, and also how international sports competitions were used in Cold War political struggles, all on the example of Soviet Ukrainian Lviv. The exhibition concludes with the section <a href="/sport-in-global-city/">«Sports in the Global City»</a>, which is dedicated to athletic mega-events as impulses for infrastructure development.</p>
  <p>In connection with the exhibition we will hold a series of lectures, round-tables, discussions, film presentations and an educational program for children. We invite you to follow upcoming announcements at www.lvivcenter.org</p>
  <p>For more information, please contact Andrii Linik, the curator of exhibition projects at the Center for Urban History, tel. 275 17 34 or e-mail a.linik@lvivcenter.org.</p>
  <p>The exhibition is open daily from Wednesdays through Sundays from 11.00 to 17.00. Closed Mondays and Tuesdays.</p>
