  <h3>Sport as a commodity</h3>

  <p>By the mid-20th century top advertising executives understood that they were selling not a product, but an image. For the creation of a brand’s image, advertisers began to involve celebrities, who became a role model for consumers to follow. The Beckham couple is the most known example. The body of David Backham as an ideal image is used most powerfully by the fashion industry.</p>

  <p>Advertising brings athletes great profits. Yet such a dependency on the public image can negatively affect commercial success. In 2009 Tiger Woods became the first billionaire athlete. The main source of his wealth was advertising. His many contracts included a 105-million dollar contract with Nike. The infidelity scandal with his wife, however, damaged Woods’ ideal image. Because of this negative PR, several of his brands, such as Accenture, AT&T, Gatorade, General Motors, and Gillette, refused to further cooperate with Woods. The scandal left Woods with a loss of 12 million dollars.</p>

  <p>The popular reception of athletes as an example of the effectiveness and manifestation of social ideals opens the path to politics—the sphere of defending public interests.</p> 
  <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger – famous American action film star and body-builder, then politician, twice elected to the governorship of California as the Republican party candidate, 2003-2010.</p>
  <p>Vitalii Klichko – boxer, leader of the political party «Udar,» on the ballot for the mayor of Kyiv, declared that his party would participate in the Ukrainian parliamentary elections.</p>
