 <h3>Sport as Decoration</h3>

  <p>Sports figures and synchronized exercises played an important role in mass Soviet spectacles. The inclusion of sports elements, which demonstrated the mobilized potential of socialist society, became a popular practice not only in the USSR, but in all countries of the socialist bloc.</p>
  <p>This phenomenon began in Stalinist times. Methods of training and disciplining the population on a military model then dominated, and Soviet holidays became ideological “rituals” repeated according to the same schematic from year to year: May 1 and May 9, November 7.</p>
  <p>The “theatricalization of sport,” the elevation of sport to a new level, celebration, added to the aesthetics of the event. This aesthetic consisted in coordinated movements of a large number of participants, mostly students, although sometimes schoolchildren were included in the more simple exercises. The months-long preparations for the performance became the primary task of physical education teachers. Everything was centralized—sewing uniforms, creating the scenario, the process of preparation.</p>
  <p>These sports exercises were part of political celebration and as such, they carried ideological meaning. The vision of the breathtaking “human pyramids” or “waves” and participation in these exercises first impacted the spectator on an emotional level, encouraging collectivism. And Soviet athletes, who very often led the marching columns in parades, symbolized socialist ideals.</p>
