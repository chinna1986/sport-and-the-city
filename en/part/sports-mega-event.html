  <h3>Sports Mega-event</h3>

  <p>Sports events on a worldwide scale, such as the Olympic Games, the World and European Football (Soccer) championships, are the primary mega-events in our contemporary life. Broadcasts create a global community of spectators, and the countries in which the events take place occupy the center of attention of a global public. In 2006 2 billion spectators watched the final match of the World Championships in Germany—almost one third of the earth’s population.</p>
  <p>The 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing were the first to be simultaneously broadcast even on the internet. The status of the host country of the mega-event is recognized by the world community. Precisely because of that, and also with the hope of economic and social profit, countries strive for the right to host mega-events.</p>
  <p>Comfortable stadiums, up-to-date equipment for filming, discussion in the press, television, internet—all of this brings the sports spectacle to the auditorium. The costs of television, to bring the event to the spectators, are only rising. For example, the right to broadcast the Olympic Games from 1996-2008 cost the American television network NBC 4 billion dollars.</p>

  <h4>What does hosting a sports mega-event actually entail?</h4>

  <p>Countries who host international championships serve only as a platform for these events. Governments of the host-countries sign a series of legal-financial agreements, which protect the economic interests of the organizers. For each event the agreement is changed because it is the result of negotiations between both sides, the host countries and the organizers.</p>
  <p>In the case of the EURO-2012 Ukraine and Poland signed an agreement with UEFA, which for the duration of the tournament changes property law, intellectual property law, broadcast and advertising rights. UEFA is an organization that supports the principle of monopoly. So it is the sole owner of rights to the symbol of the tournament and to its broadcast, which UEFA can then sell to partner companies. Although the UEFA is officially a nonprofit organization, then, it is anticipated that its profits from the tournament will reach 116 million Euros. In Ukraine these costs will not be taxed, and will only partially be taxed in Poland.  This limits the possibility that hosting mega-events would bring economic profit to the city, government or local industry. The role of the host, in many ways, could be reduced to simply providing services and ensuring order.</p>

  <h4>Possibilities vs Risks</h4>

  <p>Ineffective organization of the preparation process on the part of state authorities can have negative consequences, leading even to economic crisis. This is what happened in Greece, the host country of the 2004 Olympic Games. Irrational use of European union credits in preparation for the event caused (among other factors) economic crisis, with which the country is now struggling. Failed policies about the location of sports infrastructure led to the Olympic facilities sitting empty. The Olympic Village, for example, where the athletes lived, was supposed to become an elite region with a full social infrastructure: schools, shops, etc. But this did not happen. Effective organizing can have the positive long-term effect of enticing tourists, as was in the case with the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, now on the list of cities most visited in the world.</p>

  <h4>«Monopoly Ads»</h4>
  <p>UEFA advertising is divided into thematic niches, each of which is reserved for one of the UEFA partner companies. These are: Adidas for sportswear, McDonald’s for food, Coca Cola for cold beverages, Castrol for motor oil, Hyundai for cars, etc. Products of competitor-companies will not be advertised at EURO-2012. So companies who are not partners with UEFA have essentially no possibility of receiving any profit from the event. Such limited market competition is a negative factor, especially for local business. For example, local brands of beer do not have the right to advertise, because this niche is reserved by UEFA only for the company Carlsberg.</p>
