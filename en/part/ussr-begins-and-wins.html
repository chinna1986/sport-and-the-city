  <h3>Cold War: Polarization and Globalization</h3>

  <h4>USSR: «Begins and Wins»</h4>

  <p>«Kozakevich’’s Gesture» at the 1980 summer Olympic games in Moscow: an emotional reaction to his victory, or a demonstration of a political position? Wladyslaw Kozakiewicz was a Polish athlete, Olympic champion and world record holder, who succeeded in vanquishing his Soviet opponent in the pole vault competition. The demonstration of his offensive gesture in Moscow in front of the eyes of the world public resonated in the press and was considered a protest against the socialist regime. The scandal reached such a height that the USSR’s representative in Poland attempted to remove the athlete’s medal. Polish authorities defended Kozakiewicz, however, explaining his gesture as a brain spasm, or an expression of joy.</p>

  <p>The USSR prepared rigorously to enter the worldwide sports arena and conquer it. In 1948 the USSR sent a delegation to observe the London games, and the state then declared its future participation in the Olympics. In 1951 the National Olympic Committee of the USSR was officially created and recognized by the International Olympic Committee.</p>

  <p>The confrontation between the USA and the USSR became the major focus of the Olympic games. The USSR first competed in the Olympics in the summer Helsinki games, and succeeded in sharing first place for total medals won with the USA. In the Olympiads between 1952 and 1980 the USSR dominated in the total number of medals won--with the exception of two games, in which the USA succeeded in surpassing its global rival.</p>

  <h4>Participation as Declaration</h4>

  <p>The newly-created states made use of membership in the International Olympic Committee as a means of legitimizing themselves in the larger international community. For the communist People’s Republic of China, or the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), the International Olympic Committee’s recognition of their separate national committees constituted an important sign of state creation. Thanks to the influence of representatives from the Soviet Union, the International Olympic Committee became filled with representatives of the committees from socialist states and developing countries.</p>

  <p>If 69 countries competed in the 1952 Helsinki games, 121 competed in the 1972 Munich games. By the time the USSR collapsed, the International Olympic Committee was filled with members of former Soviet republics. Currently the committee comprises 205 representatives of various states.</p>

  <p>After the collapse of the USSR, at the 1992 summer and winter Olympics, 12 former Soviet republics entered as a so-called «United Team» (Équipe Unifiée, EUN), which included Ukraine. Only Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia had their own national teams. In 1993 the International Olympic Committee recognized the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine, and from 1994 Ukraine was independently represented at the Olympic games.</p>

  <h4>«Boycotts»</h4>

  <p>The boycott and refusal to participate in sports events became potent proof of the intrusion of politics in sports. The decision may have been taken on a state level, but the resonance was international.</p>
  <p>1959: The USSR refuses to compete against the basketball team from the Republic of China (the democratic republic now known as Taiwan was at that time engaged in a war with the People’s Republic of China). This deprives the USSR of the opportunity to play in the finals.</p>
  <p>1960: Francisco Franco forbids the Spanish soccer team, whose trainer was not certain of his players’ victory, to compete against the USSR in the second match of the European Cup’s quarter-finals. The USSR launches a protest, thanks to which they receive the right to play in the finals in Paris--where they win first place.</p>
  <p>1962: As a sign of protest against the Berlin Wall the East German hockey team is refused visas to compete in the world championships in Colorado Springs. The USSR publically protests this action.</p>
  <p>1973: The USSR refuses a match with the team from Chili, where not long before the socialist regime of Salvador Allende was deposed.</p>
  <p>1980: The USA boycotts the Olympics in Moscow following a decision made by President Jimmy Carter. The reason for the boycott was the Soviet’s sending troops to Afghanistan in 1979.</p>
  <p>1984: The USSR and 14 countries of the socialist bloc boycott the Los Angeles Olympics over security concerns--which was taken as an answer to the USA’s previous boycott of the Moscow games.</p>
