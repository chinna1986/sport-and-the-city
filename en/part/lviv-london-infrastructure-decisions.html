  <h3>Lviv – London: Infrastructure Decisions</h3>

  <p>Both cities won the opportunity to realize ambitious projects: in 2005, London secured the right to host the 2012 summer Olympics, while in 2007 Lviv became one of the host cities for the European football (soccer) championships EURO-2012. For both cities this chance offered possibilities for their promotion, development of infrastructure, lifting the social morale. Although the experience and scale differ, the cases of London and Lviv highlight the importance of the organization of the preparation process, transparency regarding the inclusion of private investors, and allocation of state costs. Sports mega-events demand the building of stadiums, projects requiring significant responsibility and requiring huge financial investments. However, the completion of construction does not constitute proof of success. The primary long-term task remains ensuring that the facility brings at the very least not a loss, if not a profit, to the city. A building of such a scale also demands developing the infrastructure of the surrounding micro region, because this facilitates including it in the city’s urban space.</p>

  <h4>London: “Reduce – Reuse - Recycle”</h4>
  <p>The «Olympic Stadium» in London is municipal property and calculated to hold 80 thousand spectators. Costs for its building reached 774 million dollars. In comparison with Beijing’s «Birds’ Nest,» which impressed spectators with its design, the London stadium was conceived first and foremost as a social project. Its construction, which lasted from 2007 to 2011, was grounded on the principle of «reduce, reuse, recycle.» The lower part of the stadium was built well into the ground in order to reduce the use of metal by 75%. At the same time, the natural landscape and industrial waste were used for construction. In order to reduce costs for maintenance, it was decided that after the Olympics the upper rows of seats would be taken down in order to reduce the size of the stadium to 60 thousand.</p>
  <p>London’s stadium is a part of a larger infrastructure, Olympic Park, which was begun parallel with construction on the stadium. And the park, in turn, is part of Stratford City, located in an economically depressed region of London. Olympic Park is intended to become the center of East London Tech City – the «Silicon Valley» of London. The third-largest shopping center in Britain, called «Westfield,» was built close by, which is supposed to encourage the development of this part of the city.</p>
  <p>There exist several strategies for the development of sports infrastructure after the Olympics: the stadium’s use by local sports clubs, transformation of the Olympic Village into apartment buildings, creation of a museum of the Olympic movement in 2014 on the territory of Olympic Park, as well as a university of ecological technology, sports studies and digital media.</p>

  <h4>Lviv: “We are waiting for EURO”</h4>

  <p>Construction of the stadium «Arena Lviv» lasted from 2008-2011. Its construction cost 375 million dollars, and the resulting stadium holds 34,915 spectators. It is the fourth-largest stadium in Ukraine and the one with the most well-lit and visible field of play. The main achievement of this stadium is the very fact of its completion, but there was a lack of conceptual decision-making around its building.</p>
  <p>The stadium is located outside Lviv. It is close to the Stryiskyi bus station and the shopping center «King’s Cross.» The stadium was designed as a key element in the development of the micro region of Sykhiv. However, it is apparent now that the largest problem is the lack of infrastructure: from the stadium to the closest public transport stop is 1.5 km, and there is no direct link to the stadium from the city in Sykhiv at all.  So it is currently unknown how this building will become a part of the everyday life of Lviv’s inhabitants after the tournament.</p>
  <p>After the end of EURO-2012 the stadium will also face the question of its occupancy. Right now there is no clear strategy for use of Arena Lviv, aside from mass events and football matches of the Karparty club, for whom the stadium will be home. There are only broad outlines of a plan for its use, which include a weekly market close to the stadium intended to attract locals, and building on the territory of the stadium parking lot the largest Karting Park in Western Ukraine. The promotion of the stadium will be managed by a specially-created commercial department.</p>
