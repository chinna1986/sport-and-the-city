  <h3>Lviv Football: Between the Local and the National</h3>

  <p>To play football in Lviv, known as Lwów and Lemberg, meant to continuously face the choice of local, national, individual and club identity. Often the Ukrainian-Polish football opposition took on particular emotional resonance and led to fights, dirty games and accusations of referees making unjust calls. On the other hand, the interest in sports and desire to win could push the national question to second place. In the foreground local and professional interests could dominate.</p>
  <p>The birth of a Polish national state in 1918 allowed the Poles to create a series of state institutions that managed the organization of athletic life in the interwar years. From 1919 the «Polish Football Union» (Polski Związek Piłki Nożnej, PZPN) was active. The county of Lviv--which included Lviv (or Lwów), Peremyshl (or Przemyśl), Ivano-Frankivsk (or Stanisławów), Stryi, and Ternopil (or Tarnopił) fell under its jurisdiction. In 1927 the «Polish Football League» (Liga Polska w Piłce Nożnej, LPPN) was formed. The new political situation strengthened the domination of Polish football teams in interwar Lwów-Lviv. At the same time, the situation with Ukrainian and Jewish clubs was more complicated, because these became clubs of national minorities in the framework of a new national government, and no longer the multi-ethnic Habsburg empire.</p>
  <p>The oldest and strongest football clubs of Lwów-Lviv were the Polish teams. In 1903, with a difference of a few days, two clubs were founded: «Fame» (Sława) (from 1905 called «The Blacks,» or Czarni) і «Lekhia» (Lechia). These were the oldest football clubs of Poland. The most decorated team of Lwów-Lviv was «Pogon» (Pogoń), which was Polish champion four times (1922, 1923, 1925, 1926) and three times the runner-up (1932, 1933, 1935).</p>
  <p>There were also Ukrainian and Jewish football teams. In 1911 on the initiative of Ivan Boberskyi, Ukrainian advocate of the gymnastics and sports movement, the sports club «Ukraine» was created. A football team trained with the group, which made the club very popular. The team «Ukraine» was runner-up in Lviv county three times (1937-1939). The most well-known Jewish team was «Hasmonea,» which played in the top-tier Polish league. The team’s greatest success in the interwar years was 11th place in the 1927 World Championships.
  <p>To play for the Ukrainian and Jewish clubs was not only an athletic, but also a national choice. Ukrainian and Jewish footballers, who wanted to play at the highest, or state, level, often became members of Polish clubs. Playing next to Poles on the Lviv team, for example, were Ukrainian and Jewish footballers.</p>

  <h4>«A Six-Minute Start...»</h4>
  <p>«I stood for a bit at a distance from the team by the goalposts of the Krakow team, where there was a hellish digging. Suddenly from the crowd the ball flew out and just rolled up to my legs. Not thinking too long, I waved my right leg and with a strong hit I aimed the ball towards the pile of players from both teams. The ball flew over them and unexpectedly appeared in front of the Krakow team’s goalie. He managed to raise his hands, but it was too late—the ball had already passed him.» Włodzimierz Chomicki, scored the victory goal in the Lwów-Krakow match (1:0)</p>
  <p>In 1894 in Lwów (Lviv, Lemberg) a major event took place—The General Regional Exhibition. Exhibitions that demonstrated countries’ successes and achievements were a very popular practice in Europe and America at the turn of the 20th century. Galician politicians believed that such an exhibition in the city would have wide international resonance. The exhibition was divided into 33 sections, and 129 pavilions presented various achievements, as well as innovations in science and technology, such as fountains with electric light, aeria cableways and electric tramways that carried spectators to the exhibition space – in Stryiskyi Park.</p>
  <p>Numerous events took place under the aegis of the exhibition, including congresses of experts in various sectors of the economy and a lottery for the mass spectator. Gymnastics and fire-fighting were presented in special sessions. As part of the exhibition model performances of gymnasts were organized--which enjoyed great popularity. It was during this exhibition that Lviv’s inhabitants were presented with a new kind of sport: football. On July 14, 1894 the Sokol teams of Krakow and Lviv played a final match in Lviv (0:1) that lasted 6 minutes long, only until the first scored goal. The game was chaotic. The footballers were trying simply to kick the ball into the goals (the goalpost was marked by flags) of the opposing team. The game had neither strategy, nor tactics. Scoring the goal was a 16-year-old second-year student at the teachers’ seminary: Włodzimierz Chomicki.</p>
  <p>Soon the match occupied a leading place in Ukrainian and Polish football history. Since the majority of players were Poles and represented the Polish organization «Sokol,» the Poles consider the match the first official game in the history of Polish football, and Chomicki the scorer of the first goal in Polish football history. In 1999 the Football Federation of Ukraine named July 14, 1894 as the birthday of Ukrainian football, however, because the match took place in Lviv.</p>

  <h4>The First Edition of Rules of the Game for Football</h4>
  <p>This new type of sport—football—was understood in Galicia to a great degree thanks to the appearance of a book explaining the rules and principles of the English sport in detail. One of the first promoters of football was Edmund Cenar, a teacher in the pedagogical seminary, who brought the first ball for football from England. In 1891 the rules of the game were published in Polish in the pamphlet Gory gimnastyczne młodzieży szkolnej («Gymnastic Games for Schoolchildren»), which came out in Lviv in a translation by Edmund Cenar. In 1894 at the height of the Polish Sokol movement in Lviv football was first played before an urban public.</p>
  <p>In Ukrainian the rules first appeared in print thanks to Ivan Boberskyi, who in 1906 published a handbook for football called, Kopanyi miach, or, Football.</p>

  <h4>Soiuzniak</h4>
  <p>At the beginning of the 20th century in Galicia «football» was called by various names: soccer, futbal’, piłka nożna, kopanyi miach (literally, ball that is kicked or dug), football, לאָבטופ רעד . Ukrainians in Galicia also used the name soiuzniak, or «association.» This came from the British Football Association, created in London in 1863, which codified the rules of contemporary football. Since football at that time included various games with a ball (football, rugby), the name «association football» clarified which particular game was meant. In Galicia the word was Ukrainianized and this popular kind of sport was called «association»—soiuzniak. But this word did not last, and in Ukrainian today we use the word «football.»</p>
