  <h3>Constructing the Urban Sport Infrastructure</h3>

  <h4>Pragmatics of Decisions</h4>
  <p>The urban infrastructure was supposed to embody the Soviet policy of sports development. On the background of consolidating new Soviet authority and developing industrialization, Soviet officials in Lviv concerned themselves with constructing and reconstructing spaces for practicing athletics.</p>
  <p>In the postwar period Lviv athletics developed on the base of an infrastructure remaining from the interwar period. The Soviet authorities actively made use of the places formerly occupied by various athletic organizations, such as the interwar Polish “Sokol” organization, including the stadiums and the swimming pools. This gave Lviv athletics the opportunity to assert itself in the greater USSR sports landscape.</p>
  <p>City authorities not only renovated pre-existing infrastructure, but also increased the number of athletic facilities by reconstructing objects that were not previously designed for sports. At that time the postwar budget provided funds only for renovation, and not construction. Often this was made possible through the method of “people’s construction”--by involving students.</p>
  <p>The Sports Park dating from 1928 (in Polish, Park Sportowy) on Kleparov Street acquired a new swimming pool and a renovated stadium—and became the fitness complex for the Army Sports Club.</p>
  <p>Religious buildings also became victims to the “demands of the time.” The synagogue Jankel Jantser Shul on Vuhilna Street was re-outfitted as a gymnasium for the Polygraphic Institute in the 1960s, and on the place of St. Vincent’s church, which was begun in 1937, a sports complex called “Labor Reserves” was built in 1972.</p>
  <p>In the 1960s and 1970s new sports facilities were constructed, including the “Friendship” stadium in the Sknyliv region of the city, the Dynamo complex, and the Spartak Palace of Sport.</p>
