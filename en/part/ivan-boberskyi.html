<h3>Ivan Boberskyi (1873–1947)</h3>
<p>The success of the export of sports and gymnastics practices from Europe to the Ukrainian environment of Galicia was to a great extent due to one person: Ivan Boberskyi. One of the best teachers of German in Lviv, he dedicated the majority of his life to the popularization of sports games and gymnastics in Galicia. After completing courses of sports pedagogy in Vienna, Boberskyi traveled throughout Europe studying various athletics examples in various countries. For many Boberskyi was a «model person,» who had a harmonious union of spiritual and physical qualities, was open to new ideas, hungry for new impressions, and sought to actively change the world around him. </p>

<p>At the end of the 19th century Boberskyi tried to introduce seemingly-incomprehensible foreign sports to replace traditional Galician games, including the popular kichka. At first Boberskyi’s strange ideas provoked a strong negative reaction among conservative Galician Ukrainians. However, his continuous and thorough organizational work in the preparation of cadres, publication of handbooks, formation of sports terminology, translation of rules for popular games (football, hockey, tennis), the purchase of land for building a stadium («Ukrainian Town»), the founding of societies and clubs—all influenced the creation of an athletics and gymnastics movement and infrastructure in Galicia. For the Ukrainian community of poor and agrarian Galicia gymnastics and sports offered yet another possibility for social, national, and gender emancipation and modernization.</p>

<p>Boberskyi’s activity is also an example of the union of two models of modern sports—the British and the German-Swedish—in a local context. On the one hand, he popularized the principles of competition and records, which is part of the British model of competitive sports. On the other hand, however, for Boberskyi it was important to unite gymnastics exercises with paramilitary practices and patriotic rhetoric, which were the foundation of the German-Swedish model. From 1908-1914 he headed the sports society «Sokil-Batko» (Sokol-Father) and in 1915 he entered the Head Ukrainian Council—the political representation of Ukrainians of Galicia during World War I. Yet another example of the union of sports and national movements was the creation in 1911, on Boberskyi’s initiative, of the sports club «Ukraine.» Despite the growth of various kinds of sports, the important goal of this particular society was the public use of the word «Ukraine.»</p>

<h4>Ukrainian Sokol Groups</h4>

<p>“O Ukrainian Sokol Girl! Before you stands an enormous task. You must raise the new generation of the nation: healthy in body and strong in spirit. In order, however, to stay on top of this task, we must first reeducate you! You must create a new type of citizen-woman, who will, despite her social work, become a model mother, wife, sister, and hostess.» This was written in 1937 in Sokil News about the role of women in the society. «Sokil» was the Ukrainian variant of the Slavic Sokol groups.</p>

<p>Much attention was devoted to the inclusion of women and girls in the activities of sports and gymnastics societies. At the beginning of the 20th century Ivan Boberskyi gave a series of presentations in which he underscored the necessity of creating female gymnastics and gymnastics sections for girls in the Sokol organization. The participation of women in the gymnastics movement was widespread not only in the cities, but also in the villages. Many Galician Ukrainian villagers belonged to a gymnastics society called «Sich,» which was popular in the countryside. Women together with men took part in physical exercises and celebrations. For women there was a specially elaborated series of gymnastics exercises with kerchiefs, towels, and clubs.</p>

<p>By joining Sokol or Sich or other sports clubs, women moved outside the bounds of privacy associated exclusively with the family, and into the public sphere. However women’s primary goal was seen not as the achievement of great athletic results, but as developing qualities useful for society, such as patriotism and social work.</p>

<h4>Sport for Youth</h4>

<p>Athletic gymnastics organizations in Galicia were oriented on youth and adults. Children practiced sports in schools. At the beginning of the 20th century the idea of creating separate children’s groups arose. To a great extent children’s sports and gymnastics developed through the Polish scouting organization created at the beginning of the 20th century, “Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego” and the Ukrainian scouting organization «Plast.» In other Polish and Ukrainian gymnastics societies the issue of physical and patriotic education of the younger generation was also raised. For example, the Ukrainian sports-gymnastics association Sich began a campaign to start «Children’s Sich» in villages and cities of Galicia where adult societies already existed.</p>
