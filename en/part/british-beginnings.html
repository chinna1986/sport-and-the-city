  <h3>«British Beginnings» of Sports</h3>

  <h4>Sport in the Industrial City</h4>
  

  <p>The sprawling industrial cities of Great Britain became one of the centers of the growth of professional sports. At first sports offered a way of spending free time that was also accessible to workers. Thanks to the introduction of labor laws the length of the work week was slowly regulated. At the same time, with increased migration to the cities in search of work, former villagers (now, new workers) continued the traditions of folk games, which in these new conditions were subjected to significant changes.</p>
  <p>Most popular sports in 19th century Great Britain - horse racing, running, cricket, wrestling, boxing, pedestrianism--provided an opportunity to place bets. Sport became not only a popular entertainment, but also a way of making money. Over time games became more commercialized. The inclusion of significant financial resources in the athletic sphere laid the foundations of professional sports and made sports an important part of urban life and significant factor in urban development.</p>

  <h4>Sport and Universities</h4>

  <p>Parallel to the great industrial cities sport developed in elite British schools and universities, especially in Oxford and Cambridge. The most popular kinds of sports here were track and field athletics, tennis, rowing, games with a ball (forerunners of football and rugby). For the higher circles of British society athletic games were a way of socializing. They had to teach gentlemanly behavior, responsibility, self-confidence, control of emotions, and most importantly, social communication. The moral ideals of sports turned out to be a path to the appearance of individual and team mastery, and also in subordination to rules of the impartial fair game, the goal of which was the achievement of high results.</p>

  <h4>Clubs and Associations</h4>

  <p>In the 1860s the first athletic clubs and associations appeared in Great Britain, which formed primarily out of  a desire to regulate the rules and organize competitions. In 1863 the Football Association was founded, followed in 1871 by the Rugby Football Union, and later the National Association of Swimming (1874), boxing (1880), track and field athletics (1880), rowing (1882), and cycling (1884). Organizing a clear structure and enforcing the rules became not only a foundation of contemporary sports, but also a guarantee of sports’ successful export to various different countries and societies.</p>

  <h4>Amateurs vs. Professionals</h4>

  <p>The growth of athletic games was accompanied by a division into amateur and professional sports. Professional sports appeared, mostly, in the cities. To a great extent these became a source of profit both for players and for their middlemen—bookies, sports agents, club owners. The commercial success of sports led to the investment of more and more capital. As a result athletic games became a part of a complicated system, the goal of which was not always to show a spectacular game with excellent results, but rather to gain a profit.</p>
  <p>Opponents to this practice were amateur clubs, created by representatives of the upper classes. They believed that playing for money was in direct opposition to the idea at the very heart of athletics, that is, a desire for perfection and demonstration of the best physical and moral qualities of a human being. They supported «pure» amateur sports and as acted as the primary popularizers of the principles of fair play. The idea of amateur sports gained a wide international resonance, and one of its manifestations was the Olympic project of Pierre de Coubertin.</p>
  <p>Amateur and professional sports co-existed for a long time. However, professional sports eventually began to dominate, since professional athletes surpassed amateurs in their athletic mastery and achieved higher results, and their performances were more spectacular.</p>

  <h4>Sport and Empires</h4>

  <p>The popularity of various kinds of sports very quickly spread beyond the borders of Great Britain and expanded throughout the world– the United States, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa. British Empire and colonialism, above all, facilitated this diffusion. English sailors, industrial workers, merchants, officials, officers and tourists were the main promoters of sports abroad.</p>
  <p>One of the most widespread team sports was English football. Another well-known British sport—cricket—became the leading game in Australia, South Africa, India and Pakistan. The acceptance of British sports in other countries allowed Britain to maintain its leading position in world sports and act as the legislator of athletic fashion for a long time. It was the British who initiated the creation of many international organizations and used their own laws as a model for international laws. In this way, the export of British--and soon European--sports can be considered as a part of the first phase of globalization.</p>
