  <h3>Sport and the Second World War</h3>
            
  <p>For Lviv (or Lwow, as the city was then known), as for all of Poland, World War II began in September 1939. Once the Soviet authorities had occupied Lviv, they immediately started to transform all spheres of life, including sports. Athletics were pronounced as an important factor in building the new socialist society. National sports clubs were liquidated, and replaced with sports associations affiliated with institutions or enterprises and including Poles, Jews, and Ukrainians. Polish athletes dominated the new clubs, because they constituted the majority and had more professional experience.</p>
  <p>With the arrival of the Germans in 1941, the national factor became definitive for local sports. For Jews, participation in athletic life became impossible because of the policies directed first towards their exclusion and isolation, and soon, total destruction. The occupying authorities consciously exacerbated the opposition between the Poles and Ukrainians, while giving preference to the latter. Such an "encouraging" situation for Ukrainian sports, on the one hand, demonstrated a political inclination towards Ukrainians, but on the other hand, created an additional source of leisure activity for German soldiers.</p>
  
  <h4>A Radical Change in Possibilities</h4>

  <p>During the German occupation in Galicia new opportunities appeared for Ukrainian sports. In 1943 the Ukrainians were for the first time able to organize their own national championships. In fall 1943 the title of "champion of Galicia" was won by the club "Skala" from Stryi. The next competition in 1944 was cancelled due to the approaching military front.</p>
  <p>One of the few international successes of Ukrainian hockey players is associated with the German occupation. In January 1942 the Lviv hockey team "Ukraine" was invited to compete in a tournament in Krakow. The opponents to the team were German, Polish, and Czech clubs. The Lviv team managed to win every match and take the entire tournament. A player from the Ukraine team, Liubomyr Tsymbalystyi, recalls:</p>
  <p>"Unexpectedly for us we turned out to be the strongest. Before this the Poles and the Russians forbid us from travelling abroad, to play and promote our mastery in international competitions....it's not that we did not hope for this, just that we did not expect it."</p> 
  
  <h4>"Match of Death": Myth and Reality</h4>

  <p>The image of sport as a "field of battle" was created after the war, mostly for ideological and propagandistic purposes. The most celebrated example of the postwar transformation of history is the legend about the football "match of death" between the Kyiv team "Dynamo" and the Luftwaffe team in occupied Kyiv in August 1942.</p>
  <p>According to stories spread after the war, the occupiers gathered the Dynamo team and forced them to play against the German flyers, and ordered that under no circumstance should they win the match. For defying this order, the Germans promised death by shooting. Despite the threat, however, the Soviet players still won the game, and were immediately shot in Babyi Iar. For many this myth was a true story from World War II.</p>
  <p>As researchers know today, the legend about the "match of death" is based on real events—but only partly. On August 9 a team of workers from the bread factory "Start," a team composed primarily of players from Dynamo, really did enter the stadium "Zenith" and really did play the German amateur team "Flakelf." The Kyiv players also won—5 to 3. But it is hard to consider this particular match as anything special. The former Dynamo team members played several times against the Germans in occupied Kyiv--and won the majority of matches with no negative consequences. Four players from Dynamo were, in fact, shot, but for other reasons, although scholars have not quite yet clarified this matter.</p>
