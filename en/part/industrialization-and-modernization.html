  <h3>Industrialization and Modernization</h3>
  <p>The “invention” of contemporary sports is inextricably linked to the industrial revolution and to modernization processes in Europe. Industrialization led to the emergence of a new kind of citizen—the factory worker—and the formation of a middle class. The emergence of large industrial cities necessitated additional housing, improved sanitary conditions, development of urban infrastructure, changes in legal regulation and political administration. The new society faced the needs of organizing and ordering an entirely new sphere of activity: how to spend free time. Public space—parks, gardens, theaters and sports fields—became typical places of relaxation for city dwellers.</p>
  <h4>New Conception of the Human Body</h4>
  <p>The ideal person of 19th century industrial society was endowed with Protestant virtues of restraint, equilibrium, organization, orderliness and moderation. These qualities also manifested themselves in a certain physical image: well-built, active, healthy, able and persevering. This ideal became a symbol of the economic and social well-being of a new age.</p>
  <h4>Nationalism</h4>
  <p>With the emergence of national governments and nationalist movements in Europe physical strength and citizens’ health was «placed at the service» of the government—whether existing or imagined. Active state policy in the sphere of health and education, as well as a network of associations and clubs, encouraged the mass introduction of athletic practices into everyday life. It was the gymnastics movement that most responded to these ideals of patriotic education. The subordination of the individual person to the whole, as reflected in the practice of various physical exercises performed synchronously, proved an example of an ideal society. Every person, so it was thought, worked for his own and the greater good in harmony and understanding with others. The gymnastics movement acquired especial predominance in Germany, and soon after in Sweden, Italy, France, and Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
  <h4>Two Models</h4>
  <p>The British model of sports and the German-Swedish model laid the foundations for contemporary sports and physical education. Essentially, the British model was founded on the principles of competition and team sports, directed at conflict, victory and achievement of the best results—records. The German-Swedish model involved synchronized performances of physical exercises with or without equipment. These exercises were performed collectively according to the directions of the leader.</p>
