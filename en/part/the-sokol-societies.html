  <h3>THE SOKOL SOCIETIES</h3>

  <blockquote>It is not education, wealth, or political might that keeps people from life; everything that a people once had, but has now lost, this is why they are unhealthy and morally fallen. Only health and morality guarantee the life of the people.</blockquote>

  <h4>Miroslav Tirsh</h4>

  <p>In East Central Europe sports developed different meanings than in Western Europe because of the imposition of imperial policies towards various, and often mutually exclusive, national ideas. The tension between different nations and ethnic groups, living in states whose borders were constantly shifting, overlapped with athletic practice. Sports became an opportunity for the legal and public representation of the nation, a means of declaration and articulation of wider social, cultural and political ideas, and opportunity to demonstrate the achievements of various groups. </p>  
  <p>In the second half of the 19th century the «Sokol» («Falcon» in Slavic languages) groups became popular in the Habsburg Empire. These were created on the model of the German gymnastics societies (turnverein). The Sokol organizations could be considered the key organization in the modern physical education of Slavic peoples. The first Sokol associations created workshops on the initiative of Miroslav Tirsh in 1862 in Prague. The Sokol movement quickly spread among other Slavic peoples—Slovenians, Croatians, Serbs, Macedonians, Poles, and Ukrainians. </p>
  <p>In Galicia the Poles first created a Sokol association in 1867, and from 1867-1884 there existed one association in Lwów. From 1884, however, there appeared a network of such associations across Galicia. The first mass meeting of Sokol groups – zlot – occurred in 1892 in Lwów. The number of members of the organization grew quickly. In 1893 there were 45 societies (with 5640 members) united in the Związek Polskich Gimnastycznych Towarystw Sokolich (Union of Polish Sokol Gymnastics Societies) in the Austro-Hungarian empire, but by 1914, 261 societies were active (with close to 30 000 members). </p>
  <p>Austrian Ukrainians founded their own Sokol (or Sokil in Ukrainian) organization in 1894 on the foundation the statute of the Czech Sokol. The primary initiators were Vasyl Nahirnyi and Volodymyr Lavrivskyi. But it was during the of Ivan Boberskyi from 1908-1914 that the organization acquired a mass character. In 1914 the society included 70 000 members belonging to 974 branches active all across Galicia. </p>
  <p>The primary activity of the Sokol societies was gymnastics—the performance of free exercises and exercises with equipment, with a stick, a spear, etc. National specificity appeared in the use of particular instruments. For example, Ukrainians performed exercises with a hatchet, flag, wreath, handkerchief and hand towel. Popular among all Sokol groups were the «towers»—gymnastics figures formed by athletes. In addition to practicing gymnastics and sports, popular activities included hiking and fire-fighting. Sokol groups created music and theater groups, organized concerts, evening parties and performances. The most popular practice was local and regional mass rallies (zlot in Polish, zdvyh in Ukrainian). </p>
  <p>Like other Sokol societies, the activity of Polish and Ukrainian groups was framed by national rhetoric, and gymnastics was united with cultural, educational and paramilitary practice. On the eve of war the Polish and Ukrainian gymnastics societies became a platform for the emergence of paramilitary organizations, such as the Ukrainian «Sichovii Striltsi» and the Polish organization «Shooting Association» (Związek Strzełecki).</p>
  <h4>“Muscular Judaism”</h4>

  <p> In traditional Jewish culture physical competency and sports were not highly valued. Physical exercises were seen as goim naches (entertainment of non-Jews). Instead, learning and Talmud knowledge were valued. The ideal of male beauty was a student of the yeshiva (yeshiva bocher), who from a young age studied books. This ideal of the delicate and learned man was repeated in literature, arts, and popular culture. </p>
  <p>Zionism, which became one of the ideologies of nationalism in Europe at the end of the 19th century, played the largest role in the transformation of views about the Jewish male body. The ideology of the nation-state was accompanied by the exclusion of minorities and, for Jewish communities, anti-Semitism. The Zionist movement proposed not only the creation of an Israeli government in Palestine, but also the formation of new models of Jewish masculinity. The creation of a «new Jew» who was physically and moral healthy was intended to encourage general regeneration, the rebirth of the nation, and accumulation of strength for the building of an independent state.  </p>
  <p>The ideological founder of national Jewish gymnastics was Max Nordau, one of the co-organizers of the Zionist movement. At the congress of Worldwide Zionist Organizations in Basel in 1898 and 1901 Nordau spoke about the historical importance of forming a «new Jewishness» on the principles of so-called «muscular Judaism.» In contrast to anti-Semitic propaganda, where Jews were depicted as oppressed and weak, a new image of the Jew was necessary, the prototype of which was Bar Kokhba—the hero of the Jewish liberation movement in Roman times. His name itself became the name of the first Jewish gymnastics association founded in Berlin in 1898. On the model of the German gymnastics societies (turnverein) and the Slavic Sokol groups, there arose a network of societies called the «Maccabees.» In Galicia the centers of the gymnastics movements were in Lviv and Krakow. On the eve of World War I in Galicia there were 27 Jewish clubs with 2776 members.</p>
