<h3>The Sports and media complex</h3>

<h4>«Printed» Everyday Sports</h4>

<p>Even in the 19th century newspapers served as a consolation for those fans unable to attend sports events. Journalists narrated the matches in detail and, more importantly, developed «fan» culture, by acquainting fans with the larger athletic context. The regularity of sports announcements created in readers the habit of following sports and made sports a part of everyday life.</p>
<h4>Radio – Fanship outside the Stadium</h4>

<p>The spread of radio at the beginning of the 1920s allowed the sports audience to reach a new level. By listening to radio broadcasts, many people could witness matches not only from afar, but at the same time as those who were attending the event in person. A radio ensured the joy of immediate fanship for everyone—regardless of where they were during the match.</p>

<h4>The Television – A Rival to «Live Presence»</h4>

<p>The television constituted the next revolution in presenting sports to a wide audience. The first television sets appeared in the 1930s. The real breakthrough in sports presentation, however, was in the 1970s with the appearance of small mobile video cameras. The perfect image of a match or competition that television offered could compete with live attendance at the event. Television could show everything that spectators might not catch at the stadium, or could follow the match from various perspectives, or slow-down or repeat important moments in the game. The sports event became above all a television event. Athletes began to care not only about the game, but about how they looked on screen in order to gain popularity among their audience.</p>

<p>A significant improvement in the television «picture» drew the attention of advertisers to sports. Already by the end of the 1980s sports as a mass-culture phenomenon lost its independent significance and became a part of the so-called «sports media complex.» This phenomenon is comprised of three mutually intertwined elements: sports, media, and advertising. The connection between them could be defined as symbiosis, or as parasitism. </p>
<p>Television uses sports to attract a wide audience and advertising money. Sports use television to find sponsors. But the rules of the game are dictated first and foremost by television. Often this is true even in a literal sense—in order to create a better spectacle the rules of certain sports can be changed. For example, the rules of rugby have undergone 5 modifications over the last 10 years. All the significant changes, such as decreasing the number of penalties, or giving the referee the right to independently interpret the rules during a match, were directed at increasing the dynamism and speed of play.</p>
