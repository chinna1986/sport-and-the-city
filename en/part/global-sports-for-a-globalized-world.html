<h3>Global Sports for a Globalized World</h3>

<p>Globalization is a lengthy historical process connected with trade, empires, and colonial systems. Now the globalized world is associated primarily with transnational corporations, easy transfer of capital, use of cheap labor, mass cultural consumption, and the global circulation of products and information.</p>
<p>What place does sport occupy in this process? Sport, or, more precisely, everything connected with it — the broadcast of sports tournaments, tickets to international sports events, advertising of sports clubs, sporting goods — is a part of the global entertainment industry.</p>
<p>The global market unites the local and the transnational. Sports clubs, who have local attachment to a certain city or country, can become the property of foreign business. For example, Abu Dhabi United Group is the owner of the football (soccer) team «Manchester City,» the Japanese businessman Hiroshi Yamauchi is the owner of the baseball team «Seattle Мariners,» Russian businessman Roman Abramovich owns the football team «Chelsea».</p>

<h4>Global Organizers</h4>

<p>Global sports associations, such as the International Olympic Committee, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (), are registered in Switzerland as nonprofit organizations. But in reality, they can be considered international corporations. These three organizations alone possess a monopoly on the organization of international competitions. They divide profits from advertising and tournament broadcasts. They hold competitions between countries striving to secure the chance to host international sports events. It is precisely these international sports organizations that outline the infrastructural demands for providing stadiums, housing, and transport. And meeting these demands is made possible by investments, or lies squarely on the state budget of the competition’s host country.</p>

<h4>Athletic patriotism and cosmopolitanism</h4>

<p>Despite globalization, football fans root for their favorite team or group, and patriotism is connected with local or national-- and not global--ties. However the transnational and transethnic composition of teams and clubs has become common. Transnationality and transethnicity can join with local attachment to a city or country.</p>
<p>Lionel Messi—Argentine football player, forward and symbol of Barcelona’s team. This Catholic team manifests a clear regional attachment, which is in competition with the capital’s Spanish ream «Real Madrid.» Each of the disparate fan communities—Argentine, Catholic, Spanish—considers Messi «their own.»</p>
